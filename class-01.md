# Introduction
## How the Web Works
#### When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
### For example:
#### when a web user in England wants to view the website of the Louvre art gallery in France which is located at www.1- louvre.fr. Firstly, the browser in Cambridge contacts a DNS server in London. The DNS server then tells the browser the location of the web server hosting the site in Paris.

1- When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.

2-Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.

3-The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.

4-The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

# Structure
## Let's look at the following code. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

## *head*
### Before the *body* element you will often see a *head* element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown withinthe main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a *title* element inside the *head* element.
## *title*
### The contents of the *title* element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
  
  
## _Attributes_ :
### Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
